# CVE-database
Database GUI client to manage applicant's data

This entire program is released under the GPL3 license. A copy of the GPL3 license is included in the "code" listing.

A GUI client to assist a CVE with managing applicants for when the applicant comes back for a license upgrade.

Data import files are generated by https://examtools.org

Requirements:

python 3.8 or newer installed

This program accomplishes GUI simplified database queries. A more adavnced version will be a W.I.P.

Current version can be found in the "About" menu or in the Wiki for this project.

## Version 0.94 has been posted. 

For a previous version of CVE-DB, the existing database will need to be deleted and the session files will need to be imported again.

CVE-DB has dropped the W5YI.dat file import in favor of the session JSON file. The json files are VEC agnostic. So if your VEC requires uploading the session JSON file, it will be a simple matter to import that session file into CVE-DB.

The session file is found in the Download menu of Exam Tools as the JSON EXPORT function. The session will need to be officially closed.

Check the Wiki pages for more information.
