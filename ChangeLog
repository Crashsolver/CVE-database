0.90 - initial upload

0.91 - bug fixes

0.92 - added ability to save SQL results as a CSV file

0.92.1 - Added CSV save to SQL results display

0.93 - Added session JSON file import, removed W5YI DAT file import, added VEs to database, added a session report
        via menu. From a previous version of CVE-DB, the older database format is not compatable with the new 
        database format. The database will need to be re-built by importing the JSON session files again.

0.94 - Added ability to segregate imported JSON files by VEC. A thank you to Nick, N1CCK, for his input to this
        needed feature. The database will need to be re-built by importing the JSON session files again.


0.94.1 - An adjustment to the GUI to accomodate the longer VEC names. No need to rebuild the database if coming from version 0.94
